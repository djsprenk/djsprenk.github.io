            About Set Explorer
        </h2>
        <div>
            <p>Set Explorer is a project by about visualizing energy across DJ sets.</p>
            <p>
                Inspired loosely by <a href="https://fathom.info/rocky/">Fathom's Rocky Morphology</a> project, it mines
                and combines data across multiple sources to make it easer to search, explore, and select sets to listen
                to.
            </p>
            <p>
                For each set I have two styles of graph:
            <ol>
                <li>Timeilne</li>
                <li>Playlist</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                In the <strong>Timeline</strong> graph, height (↑↓) represents BPM, from about 50 BPM to 100 BPM, higher
                being faster.
                The horizontal (→) represents time, with bars (|) representing song changes.
            </p>
            <p>
                The color represents energy, as follows.
            <ul>
                <li><span class="song" data-energy="1">Lowest</span></li>
                <li><span class="song" data-energy="2">Low</span></li>
                <li><span class="song" data-energy="3">Medium</span></li>
                <li><span class="song" data-energy="4">High</span></li>
                <li><span class="song" data-energy="5">Highest</span></li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <img id="example-timeline" src="assets/sample-timeline.svg">
            <p>
                So, in the above "timeline" graph, the BPM is relatively flat in the first half with an increase and
                then decrease in energy. In the second half there is a steady increase in BPM and energy before slowing
                down and dropping energy in the last few songs.
            </p>
            <p>In the <strong>Playlist</strong> graph, time and BPM are not shown. Instead, songs are shown with their
                energy</p>

        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                I create mixes using <a href="https://www.virtualdj.com/">VirtualDJ</a> (VDJ) and upload them to <a
                    href="https://mixcloud.com/djsprenk">my Mixcloud account</a>. I make it a point to be very organized
                within VDJ, cataloguing playlists for each set I've recorded and tagging songs with lots of metadata,
                like the energy and musical characteristics of each.
            </p>
            <p>
                VDJ makes it really easy to export and view this data as XML, meaning it is trivial to query and operate
                on that data programmatically. I initially learned this writing scripts to automate some of my more
                repetitive DJ processes like updating cue sheet timestamps.
            </p>
            <p>
                Initially, I was most interested in visualizing the change of energy across each mix. After playing with
                several ideas for how to source that data (e.g. searching from cue point titles, reading cue sheets) and
                how to display that data (e.g. <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">Matplotlib</a>, <a
                    href="https://plotly.com/">Plotly</a>) I finally landed on an approach:
            <p>
                Since I have playlists for each set, I was able to use Python to get the songs for each playlist and
                look up their metadata (including a tag for energy). I also used <a
                    href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a> for some simple data cleaning / joining along the way.
            </p>
            <p>
                For data display, I used <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3</a> to convert song data (in JSON format, output
                from the prior scripts) into a timeline of colored <span class="code">&lt;div&gt;</span>s.
            </p>
            <p>
                I wanted to also combine information from Mixcloud (particularly album art and titles) so, using <a
                    href="https://www.postman.com/">Postman</a> and <a
                    href="https://www.mixcloud.com/developers/">Mixcloud's developer documentation</a>, I was able to
                find commands to source that data. Joining these two sources of data required creating a mapping file to
                associate playlists with their respective Mixcloud uploads.
            </p>
            <p>
                After all that, I'm left with:
            <ol>
                <li>A set of playlists and associated song metadata.</li>
                <li>Mixcloud data for each uploaded mix.</li>
                <li>A mapping file to link Mixcloud mixes and playlists.</li>
                <li>Scripts to join and package this data for web.</li>
                <li>Code to display this data on a webpage.</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
        </div>
